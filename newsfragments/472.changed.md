Synapse: Upgrade from v1.129.0 to v1.130.0.

Highlights :
- Add an Admin API endpoint GET /_synapse/admin/v1/scheduled_tasks to fetch scheduled tasks.
- Add config option user_directory.exclude_remote_users which, when enabled, excludes remote users from user directory search results.
- Add support for handling GET /devices/ on workers.
- Fix a longstanding bug where Synapse would immediately retry a failing push endpoint when a new event is received, ignoring any backoff timers.
- Fix to pass leave from remote invite rejection down Sliding Sync.
